# Welcome to Archy

**Archy** is an open ecosystem of commands connected together to create unique experience for developers and users.

You can think of a *Command* as "a small program", dedicated to do one function and deliver it's results to end user. Using Archy app on your mobile device, you can install and use these commands, like "Commands for Github" or "Commands for ..."

Our Commands are created and maintained by a community of developers. You can create your own commands and share them with the world.

## Create a New Archy Command

Command is a simple function, exposed as HTTPs endpoint, it receives arguments from Archy and returns results in Archy Response Format. That's it! Inside command, you can do any calculations, or fetch data from 3rd-party APIs.

Start by example, see tutorials or existing commands:

* Check out the [current commands](https://archy.ai/commands) for inspiration.
* Start with tutorial on creating new command.

Many of Archy commands that we built are **open sourced**, so you can contribute to commands you love or use these commands for learning and inspiration!
