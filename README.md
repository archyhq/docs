# Welcome to Archy

**Archy** is universal interface and open platform. Itself Archy is just a simple App, similar to a browser, but it's much more with Integrations.

## Get Started

1. Start by downloading Archy App for [iOS](https://archy.ai/downloads/ios) or Android \(coming soon\).
2. Visit [Services](https://archy.ai/services) to see existing integrations.
3. Use these docs and the community's support to Create your own integration.

[**Join Us and Ask questions on Slack**](https://archy-slack-inviter.herokuapp.com)** or **[**email us**](/mailto:support@archy.ai)** directly.**

## Create a new Archy Integration

Integration is a simple function, exposed as HTTPs endpoint, it receives arguments from Archy and returns results in Archy Response Format. That's it! Inside this function, you can do any calculations or fetch data from 3rd-party APIs.

Start by example, see tutorials or integration with existing Services:

* See the [current services integrations](https://archy.ai/services) for inspiration.

## Use or improve existing Integration

Many of Archy integrations that we built are **open sourced**, so you can contribute to integrations with services you like or look at the code for learning and inspiration!
